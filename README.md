About Me

I'm a frontend and mobile app developer focused on delivering clean, fast, and meaningful user experiences — both on web and mobile. I build things that matter, write code that lasts, and improve daily with purpose.

Currently building with **React** and **React Native**, while sharpening my problem-solving and product-thinking skills. I’m committed to real-world development — not just features, but how those features feel, perform, and scale.


What I Bring to the Table

- 🧠 Strong foundation in **JavaScript** and modern frontend tools  
- 💡 Focus on **UI clarity**, **component structure**, and **user experience**
- 🚀 Ability to build **end-to-end apps** — from layout to logic  
- 📱 Mobile-ready mindset: pixel-perfect design across devices  
- 🛠️ Practical use of APIs, Firebase, and local data handling


Projects That Reflect My Thinking

> Not side-projects. Not clones. These are real builds with real intent.

- 📱 **Expense Tracker (React Native)**  
  Mobile-first finance tracker with smooth transitions and persistent data.

- 🌐 **Blog Platform (React + JSON Server)**  
  Dynamic blog engine with CRUD, modular design, and clean separation.

- 🔐 **Authentication UI Kit**  
  A production-ready auth flow — login, register, forgot password — all React + Tailwind.

- ☁️ **Live Weather App**  
  Built for performance. Caches smartly. Re-renders selectively. OpenWeather API used properly.

Tools I Use Daily

- React · React Native · JavaScript  
- Tailwind CSS · Git · VSCode  
- JSON Server · Firebase (auth + db)  
- Working knowledge of REST APIs and async patterns


What I’m Working On

- 🔁 Rebuilding parts of my apps with **custom hooks** and **state machines**
- 🧩 Component libraries to reuse across projects
- ⚙️ Improving app structure for scale: folders, services, constants
- 🧪 Testing workflows (Jest + Manual testing habits)



Let's Talk

I’m open to remote roles, Onsite roles ,  frontend opportunities, and freelance collaborations where clean UI and code matter. I care about product, detail, team energy, and continuous growth.
